This folder contains unit tests for Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm used by Bitcoin:
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/ECDSA

The file format for "Key pairs" tests is as follows:
-Each test case consists of 2 lines, and is separated by 1 empty line:
	+First line contains the private key of the Koblitz Curve secp256k1.
	+Second line contains the public key of the Koblitz Curve secp256k1.
-The test is considered passed when the ECDSA algorithm given a private key generated the proper public key.

Files in this folder and their description:
-Key pairs test 1 - a basic collection of random ECDSA keypairs.
