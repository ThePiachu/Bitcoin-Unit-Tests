The file format for "Address Generation" tests is as follows:
-Each test case consists of 10 lines, and is separated by 1 empty line. Each line corresponds to steps 0-9 described in the wiki page for "Technical background of version 1 Bitcoin addresses", under "How to create Bitcoin Address". Here is the extract from that page:

How to create Bitcoin Address

0 - Having a private ECDSA key

1 - Take the corresponding public key generated with it (65 bytes, 1 byte 0x04, 32 bytes corresponding to X coordinate, 32 bytes corresponding to Y coordinate)

2 - Perform SHA-256 hashing on the public key
   600FFE422B4E00731A59557A5CCA46CC183944191006324A447BDB2D98D4B408
3 - Perform RIPEMD-160 hashing on the result of SHA-256
   010966776006953D5567439E5E39F86A0D273BEE
4 - Add network byte in front of RIPEMD-160 hash (0x00 for Main Network)
   00010966776006953D5567439E5E39F86A0D273BEE
5 - Perform SHA-256 hash on the extended RIPEMD-160 result
   445C7A8007A93D8733188288BB320A8FE2DEBD2AE1B47F0F50BC10BAE845C094
6 - Perform SHA-256 hash on the result of the previous SHA-256 hash
   D61967F63C7DD183914A4AE452C9F6AD5D462CE3D277798075B107615C1A8A30
7 - Take the first 4 bytes of the second SHA-256 hash. This is the address checksum
   D61967F6
8 - Add the 4 checksum bytes from point 7 at the end of extended RIPEMD-160 hash from point 4. This is the 25-byte binary Bitcoin Address.
   00010966776006953D5567439E5E39F86A0D273BEED61967F6
9 - Convert the result from a byte string into a base58 string using Base58Check encoding. This is the most commonly used Bitcoin Address format

-The test is considered passed given the public key from point 1 (line 2), the address generator successfully creates a base58-encoded Bitcoin Address from point 9 (line 10).
